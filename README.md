### App name: questionapp

* Frontend for retrieving and delivering questions for surveys, for example for events, answers can be selected and the results displayed the results for users in charts with percentages and other useful information, uses PhoneGap to provide the app for mobile. Written in JavaScript. ChartsJS is used for displaying the charts.

* Instead of PhoneGap for delivering this on mobile devices, alternatively the 'www' directory can also simply be uploaded to a normal web server and used like that too, which will be available to be viewed on mobile devices too. Requires an API endpoint to retrieve questions and users.

* Edit the files (html/javascript/css) in the questionapp/www directory.
